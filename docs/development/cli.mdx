Browser Use ships with a Textual-based CLI that lets you experiment with agents directly from your terminal. After installing the package you can start the interface with:

```bash
browser-use
```

The CLI reads any API keys from your `.env` file and will launch a browser window alongside a terminal UI where you can enter tasks.

## Options

You can inspect the available command line options with `--help`:

```bash
browser-use --help
```

Key flags include:

- `--model` – specify the LLM model to use (for example `gpt-4o`).
- `--debug` – enable verbose logging during startup.
- `--headless` – run the browser in headless mode.
- `--window-width` / `--window-height` – override the browser window size.

The CLI persists a small configuration file at `~/.browser_use.json` so that your last used options are remembered between sessions.

<Note>
  The CLI uses the same agent implementation as the library. Refer to the other documentation pages for details on configuration and supported models.
