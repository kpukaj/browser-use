## Overview

Set `record_workflow=True` (or provide `save_playwright_script_path`) when creating an `Agent` to save a Playwright script of a successful run. The script can be executed later without the LLM.

### Enable Recording

```python
from browser_use import Agent
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

agent = Agent(
    task="Open example.com and finish",
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"),
    record_workflow=True,  # saves to ./workflow.py by default
)
await agent.run()
```

Specify a custom path:

```python
agent = Agent(
    task="Demo",
    llm=llm,
    record_workflow="scripts/demo.py",
)
```

### Replay

Install Playwright browsers and run the script:

```bash
playwright install
python scripts/demo.py
```

### Security Notes

Recorded scripts may include visited URLs and text content. Placeholders defined via `sensitive_data` are replaced with environment variables in the script. Review and handle recordings carefully before sharing.
